# Default WordPress theme

The actual theme for this website.

What makes WordPress see this theme even though it is not in the standard theme
location is the
[`register-theme-directory`](../public/wp-content/mu-plugins/register-theme-directory.php)
plugin.

To understand how WordPress decides which template to use, check out the
[documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/).
There is also this quick
